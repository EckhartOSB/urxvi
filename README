DESCRIPTION

Perl extension for rxvt-unicode (aka urxvt) to enable the user to
navigate the terminal window using the keyboard.  The supplied urxvirc
file implements key bindings similar to the default bindings for vi
for cursor movement and text selection.

INSTALLATION

See the man page for urxvtperl(3) for a full discussion of Perl
extensions.  Enable this extension using one of the methods documented
there.  For example, you could place the script urxvi in
/usr/local/lib/urxvt/perl, then add the following to .Xdefaults:

URxvt.perl-ext: default,urxvi
URxvt.keysym.0xff14:	  perl:urxvi

This binds the Scroll Lock key to enable urxvi's functionality.


OPERATION

On initialization, this extension first tries to load any "urxvirc" file found
in the same directory as the "urxvi" script itself.  No error occurs if this
file cannot be found.  Next, any script specified by the resource
URxvt.urxvi.rxfile will be loaded -- again, silently failing if not found.

Once the extension is invoked vie the "urxvi" user command, the extension
captures all keyboard input to the terminal window until either a 'quit'
command is executed or the 'urxvi' user command is repeated.  

The supplied version of urxvirc provides the following key bindings:

^		move to the first non-space character on the current row.
$		move to the last non-space character on the current row.
+, <Return>	move to the beginning of the (current + (repeat-count or 1)) row.
-		move to the beginning of the (current - (repeat-count or 1)) row.
0		move to beginning of line, unless a repeat-count has been started
		(in which case it adds the 0 to the repeat-count).
1-9		add the digit to the repeat-count.
b		move backward to the beginning of a word (delimited by non-word chaarcters).
B		move backward to the beginning of a WORD (delimited by spaces).
e		move forward to the end of a word.
E		move forward to the end of a WORD.
G		move to the beginning of the (repeat-count or last) absolute row.
		(For most commands, rows start at 0 for the final screen-full as
		in urxvt's API, with negative numbers for scrollback rows.  In this
		command, however, they begin at 1 for the first known row.)
h, <Left>	move (repeat-count or 1) columns left.
H		move to the beginning of the first visible row.
j, <Down>	move (repeat-count or 1) rows down.
k, <Up>		move (repeat-count or 1) rows up.
l, <Right>	move (repeat-count or 1) columns right.
L		move to the beginning of the last visible row.
q		quit urxvi
v		toggle character-wise selection mode.
V		toggle line-wise selection mode.
w		move forward to the beginning of a word.
W		move forward to the beginning of a WORD.
y		if in selection mode, exit selection mode (leaving text selected)
		otherwise, wait for the next key.  If another y, select (repeat-count or 1)
		lines, starting with the current line.  For any other character, execute
		that movement in select mode, then turn off select mode.
<Home>		move to the first row.
<End>		move to the last row.
<C-b>, <PageUp> move (repeat-count or 1) pages up.
<C-d>		move (repeat-count or 1) half pages down.
<C-f>, <PageDown> move (repeat-count or 1) pages down.
<C-u>		move (repeat-count or 1) half pages up.
<Esc>		if in selection mode, exit selection mode (leaving text selected)
		otherwise, if any text is selected, clear the selection
		otherwise, quit urxvi.

When in selection mode, every cursor movement selects the text between the selection anchor
(where selection was initiated) and the current cursor position.  There are two selection
modes, "line" and "char".  The former selects whole lines, while the latter selects from/to
row/column pairs.  Selected text is immediately copied to the clipboard, as it would be if
you performed the same selection with the mouse.

When in command mode, the following default key bindings are provided by urxvirc:

<Left>		Move command cursor one character left
<Right>		Move command cursor one character right
<Enter>		Apply the command


SYNTAX

The urxvirc file and any user-supplied rc files contain commands in a simple S-expression
syntax that I like to call Slips (for "Sloppy Lisp").  See the file SLIPS-REFERENCE for full syntax.
The provided urxvirc file can serve as a good set of examples.


RESOURCES

This extension uses the following resources:

URxvt.urxvi.debug

	If set to "on", then debugging message will be sent to urxvt's stdout.
	These messages can be useful for debugging the syntax of your rc file.

URxvt.urxvi.rcfile

	If set, this resource specifies the path to an rcfile to evaluate.
